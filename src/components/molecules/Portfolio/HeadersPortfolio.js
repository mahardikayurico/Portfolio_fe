            I am a Geomatics Engineering Fresh graduate with a field of study
            Interest namely WebGIS Development. During college, I actively
            participated in organizations, so I have the ability in public
            speaking, time management, teamwork, and critical thinking. After
            graduating from university, I took part in a Fullstack Website
            Development Bootcamp, so I could improve my skills as a Web
            Developer, by learning programming languages, and web technologies,
            along with various frameworks/libraries.
